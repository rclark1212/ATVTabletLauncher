# ATVTabletLauncher

Trivial little launchpad app to consolidate, view and launch tablet/phone apps sideloaded to android tv (shield specifically).

# Summary

Just uses a simple gridview to display list of apps to launch. App list generated by looking for all apps which have a LAUNCHER intent but no LEANBACK_LAUNCHER intent (no reason to show leanback apps in this app). App list is also filtered with an exclusion list.

# Use

Build and install. It should automatically pick up any sideloaded tablet or phone apps.

Note that we do NOT support listening to dynamic installs (didn't put in a broadcast receiver). So apps sideloaded while this app is open won't show up until you restart the app.

This app also is not localized (there is an error message hardcoded in for when we can't launch).
