# ATVTabletLauncher

Trivial little launchpad app to consolidate, view and launch tablet/phone apps sideloaded to android tv (shield specifically).

# Summary

Just uses a simple gridview to display list of apps to launch. App list generated by looking for all apps which have a LAUNCHER intent but no LEANBACK_LAUNCHER intent (no reason to show leanback apps in this app). App list is also filtered with an exclusion list.

# Use

Build and install. It should automatically pick up any sideloaded tablet or phone apps.

Update - added a broadcast receiver so now if you sideload install/uninstall while in the app, the new app will show up.

This app also is not localized (there is an error message hardcoded in for when we can't launch).
